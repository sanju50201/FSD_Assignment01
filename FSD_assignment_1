Q2.Data Types in Java:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
byte		Byte	1 byte	-128 to 127   
short		Short	2 bytes -32768 to 32767 			
int 	       Integer	4 bytes 
long		Long	8 bytes 
float		Float	4 bytes	
double		Double	8 bytes	
char	     Character	2 bytes	
String			depends on the size of the string
boolean        Boolean	stores true or false
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Q5. Strings come under the section of non-primitive data types, the data is stored in the heap memory, where the address of the string is stored
Let's say you declare a string with 3 characters "Str", the data is stored in the heap memory, whereas the adress of the string is stored in stack, it's memory size will be 6 bytes here
when it is changed to "String" the memory is increased to 12 bytes and it is recreated in the heap memory and the address for it is stored in the stack, the variable just stores the 
adress of the String here. Strings in Java are immutable which means that the once the variable is created it's data cant' be changed but a new String object will be created

Q6. String pool can be defined as a storage area in Java Heap where String literals are stored. It is just like object allocation. By default, it is empty and maintained by a String Class
Whenever we create a string the string object occupies some space in heap memory, creating a number of strings may increase the memory, which may reduce the performance.
When we create a String Literal, Java runtime first checks that literal in the string pool. If the literal is already present in the pool, it returns a reference to the pooled instance. If 
the literal is not present in the pool, a new string object takes place in the string pool.

Example:
Using String literal:
String a = "Hello";
String b = "Hello World";

Using a new keyword (or) creating a new keyword:
String a = new String("Hello");
String b = new String("Hello World");

Q7. Java is generally faster than python because Java is a compiled language, whereas Python is a interpreted language which is simpler and more concise syntax than Java.
when a Java code is compiled a .class file is generated which is a machine understandable code, so whenever we need to run a java code the .class file will be used to run the java program using JRE
The runtime for Java is very fast when compared to python
